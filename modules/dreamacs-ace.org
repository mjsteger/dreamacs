* We'll want to install ace-window

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(dreamacs-require-packages '(ace-window))
#+END_SRC

* set up the keys to be convenient for my keybinding. It should be set up such that it looks up the current keyboard set. We'll also set M-o to start ace-window, since it should be convenient to start off
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq aw-keys '(?a ?s ?h ?t ?n ?e ?o ?i ?9))
(global-set-key (kbd "M-o") 'ace-window)
#+end_src


* Finally we'll provide the stuff. We'll probably remove this in the vanguard setup
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(provide 'dreamacs-ace)
#+end_src
